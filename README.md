Developed a daily Flight Difficulty Score that ranks all ORD departures by turn complexity and delay risk using multiple data sources.
Found that the top 20% of the most “Difficult” flights disproportionately account for the majority of delay minutes and tight-turn exposures, indicating a strong concentration of operational risk.

Identified clear operational drivers—short turns, hot transfers, wheelchairs/special service requests (WCHR/SSR), and high passenger load—that translate directly into focused frontline actions at T-24, T-6, and T-2 hours before departure.

Incorporated intuitive driver icons (“Turn”, “Bags”, “SSR”, “Load”) to enhance communication and understanding of difficulty factors among operations teams.
